# Bubble Tea Conventions

- Models: Init() tea.Cmd, Update(msg) (Model, tea.Cmd), View() string
- Async ops: define Msg type in messages.go, return tea.Cmd that produces it
- Child models receive width/height; call setChildSizes() when creating or resizing
- New views: add viewState const, child model field, case in Update/View/handleKey
- Inline ops: set busyVMs[name] before cmd, clear on vmOperationResultMsg
